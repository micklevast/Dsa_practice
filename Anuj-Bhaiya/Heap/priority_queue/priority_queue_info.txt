Priority Queue is special stl Library which impliment max-heap and min-heap.

What are priority queues in C++?
A priority queue in c++ is a type of container adapter, which processes only the highest priority element, i.e.
the first element will be the maximum of all elements in the queue, and elements are in decreasing order

How to implement min-heap using C++ STL?
A min-heap is a binary tree such that:
1. The data contained in each node is less than (or equal to) the data in that nodeâ€™s children.
2. The binary tree is complete

The C++ Standard Library consists of a container named priority_queue. A priority queue is technically a max-heap but it can be used to implement a min-heap by tweaking its constructor.
