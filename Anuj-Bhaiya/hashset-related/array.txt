==>By default, are left uninitialized. This means that none of its elements are set to anyparticular value; 
their contents are undetermined at the point the array is declared.

The initializer can even have no values, just the braces:
int baz [5] = { };


==>Finally, the evolution of C++ has led to the adoption of universal initialization also for arrays. 
Therefore, there is no longer need for the equal sign between the declaration and the initializer.
 Both these statements are equivalent:

int foo[] = { 10, 20, 30 };
int foo[] { 10, 20, 30 };
